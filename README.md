What this is: Time is expressed in hh:mm:ss, but it doesn't need to. In this program, you can redefine hours, minutes, and seconds, and use the format text box to change the colons into commas or semicolons, for example. To redefine hours, minutes, and seconds, you have a Scratch-inspired "program" editor, which offers you a variety of math tools to use.

How to use: Add a block to your program by clicking on it, remove a block by clicking on it. If you want to make a variable, use the first block to add the variable block. Use the Python 3 f-string syntax for format (variables are enclosed in curly brackets: {}), and use save code to save your program and see it go on your display! You can use "Use actual time" to use the actual time on your computer.
